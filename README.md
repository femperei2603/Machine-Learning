# Machine-Learning
Machine Learning Algorithms Performed on various datasets and a thorough comparison of all the datasets with each other.

## Regression on Toyota Corolla Dataset.
Steps:
1) Using the Kaggle Toyota Corolla Dataset we imputed 5% NaN values to replicate real life datasets.
2) We processed the data by getting rid of the NaN values using mean, median and mode imputation.
3) Once the dataset was ready, It was split into feature and target datasets and again into train and test datasets.
4) Min-Max scaler was used for this dataset because of its skewed nature.
5) The following regression techniques were used to determine which technique works for the dataset the best:
  a) K Neighbors Regressor
  b) Linear Regression using Normal Equation
  c) Ridge Regression
  d) LASSO Regression
  e) Polynomial Regression
  f) Linear SVM Regression
  g) SVM with Linear Kernel
  h) SVM with Poly Kernel
  i) SVM with RBF Kernel
  j) Decision Tree Regressor
  k) SGD Regressor

Conclusion: The SGD Regressor best fitted the model and after the conclusion we demonstrated how the predicted values are close to the actual values.

## Classification on Bank Loan Dataset.
Steps:
